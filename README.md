I got HP7475A plotter on eBay. In this document I will capture some of the setup I've done to get it to work, and share tools that I use with it.

First, I replaced Geneva Drive motor attachment with a 3D printed one from here:

This website had the info on how to replace the Geneva drive attachment:

Then, I 3D printed out a bunch of pen adapters to use with my pens. I got the files from here:

This resource has a lot of tips and tricks on getting the plotter to work:
